event: Second International Conference on Natural Hazards and Risks in a Changing World 2021

location: Potsdam University

summary: Natural hazards such as floods, wildfires, droughts, earthquakes, landslides, and compound events heavily affect human societies and call for better risk mitigation strategies. In the wake of changing hydro-climatological, geo-physical and socio-economic system conditions the magnitude, frequency and impacts of natural hazards might change as well. Therefore methods are needed for hazard and risk quantification accounting for transient nature of hazards and risks in response to changing natural and anthropogenic altered systems.
abstract: The purpose of this conference was to bring together researchers from natural sciences (e.g. hydrology, meteorology, geomorphology, hydraulics, environmental science, seismology, physical geography), risk research, human geography, nonlinear systems dynamics, and applied mathematics to discuss new insights and developments about impact modeling, risk assessments and risk mitigation, process understanding and the analysis of complex systems. Knowledge transfer, communication and networking have been a key issue of the conference. The conference comprised keynote speeches and invited talks given by outstanding experts, oral presentations, poster sessions and discussions
