ARIOÂ³, is an object-oriented python implementation project of the Adaptative Regional Input Output (ARIO) model [Hallegatte 2013].

Its objectives are to give an accessible and inter-operable implementation of ARIO, as well as tools to visualize and analyze simulation outputs and to evaluate the effects of many parameters of the model.
